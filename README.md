## The Old Version

### The A0.1.X Version

In this version, the main update window control content, and content hierarchical positioning.

This release has 20 subprojects, which are snapshots of each build code. The most complete version is version A0.1.0628, which was created on June 28, 2024.

Since it is a simple snapshot, all versions have no comments, etc.

### The A0.2.X Version

In this version, a few UI optimizations and animation updates were made, but they were not finished.

I'm going to refactor the code for code reasons.

The final experience project :

[Co-Creat World](https://www.ccw.site/detail/6654acbdd2694c0af571bd7a) ; [COCREA](https://cocrea.world/@LanwyWriteXU/RadiumOS)
